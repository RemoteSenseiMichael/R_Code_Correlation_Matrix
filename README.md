# R Code: Correlation Matrix

This code, writtin in the R programming language, is to create a correlation matrix from samples of remote sensing variables. The matrix is created using the ggplot2 library in R. A correlation matrix is a table showing correlation coefficients between each remote sensing variable. Each cell in the table shows the correlation between two variables.
